# PingPongGameSFML
This is a simple ping pong game using SFML in C++.
This is a Computer Science OOP project.
This is not for commercial use and is intended for personal use only.
There are loadFromFile lines which need to be replaced by the address of the location of your files.
I have uploaded all the needed files, you just need to save them somewhere and then replace the address
with the address of those files.
Thank you for reading.
